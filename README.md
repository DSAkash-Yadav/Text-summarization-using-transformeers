The Text Summarization Web Application is an easy-to-use tool that helps shorten long pieces of text into clear and meaningful summaries. It uses advanced transformer-based models through the txtai library to understand and extract the most important information from the input text.

The app is built with Streamlit, providing a simple and interactive interface. Users can either type in text or upload documents (like .txt or .pdf files) and get a summary within seconds.

This tool can be useful in many areas:

Education: Summarize research papers, textbooks, or study notes.
Business: Condense reports, meeting minutes, and market research.
Media & Journalism: Extract key points from news articles, interviews, or long reports.
